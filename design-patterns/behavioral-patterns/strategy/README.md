# Description

Strategy pattern is a [behavioral pattern](https://github.com/luixcode/design-patterns#behavioral-patterns). Its objective is to facilitate the implementation of algorithms (different ways of doing something) in a given context.

This pattern suggests isolating each algorithm in a separate class: each class implements a common interface; said interface, defines the contract between the context (read: object that uses the provided functionality) and the different strategies.
