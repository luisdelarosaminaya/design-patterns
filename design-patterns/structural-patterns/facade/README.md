# Description

Facade pattern is a [structural pattern](https://github.com/luisdelarosaminaya/design-patterns#structural-patterns). Its objective is to provide a simple interface to interact with other components.

Sometimes we are working with third-party frameworks/libraries, and in many cases our code only requires a limited set of functionalities from these tools. Facade provides an interface for interacting with these tools in a simpler way. Also, very important, it allows us to decouple our code from the frameworks/libraries that we are using.

If necessary, there can be multiple facades for a set of components.
