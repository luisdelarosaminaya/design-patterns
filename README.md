# Design patterns

## Description
This repository was created to learn/practice design patterns. The programming language is irrelevant, so I will use the one I am using/learning at the moment.

### Creational patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- [ ] Abstract Factory
- [ ] Builder
- [ ] Factory Method
- [ ] Object Pool
- [x] [Prototype](https://github.com/luisdelarosaminaya/design-patterns/tree/master/design-patterns/creational-patterns/prototype)
- [x] [Singleton](https://github.com/luisdelarosaminaya/design-patterns/tree/master/design-patterns/creational-patterns/singleton)

### Structural patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- [ ] Adapter
- [ ] Bridge
- [ ] Composite
- [ ] Decorator
- [x] [Facade](https://github.com/luisdelarosaminaya/design-patterns/tree/master/design-patterns/structural-patterns/facade)
- [ ] Flyweight
- [ ] Private Class Data
- [ ] Proxy

### Behavioral patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- [ ] Chain of responsibility
- [ ] Command
- [ ] Interpreter
- [ ] Iterator
- [ ] Mediator
- [ ] Memento
- [ ] Null Object
- [ ] Observer
- [ ] State
- [x] [Strategy](https://github.com/luixcode/design-patterns/tree/master/design-patterns/behavioral-patterns/strategy)
- [ ] Template method
- [ ] Visitor
