# Description
This repository was created in order to learn/practice the different design patterns.
I am going to use JavaScript (_although certainly the object model of this language is not the most ideal_) to practice the language, while I take my first steps in some framework like Vue.js, Angular, and/or React.

I do not rule out using some other language in the future for this project.

# Creational patterns
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- [ ] Abstract Factory
- [ ] Builder
- [ ] Factory Method
- [ ] Object Pool
- [ ] Prototype
- [x] Singleton

# Structural patterns
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- [ ] Adapter
- [ ] Bridge
- [ ] Composite
- [ ] Decorator
- [ ] Facade
- [ ] Flyweight
- [ ] Private Class Data
- [ ] Proxy

# Behavioral patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- [ ] Chain of responsibility
- [ ] Command
- [ ] Interpreter
- [ ] Iterator
- [ ] Mediator
- [ ] Memento
- [ ] Null Object
- [ ] Observer
- [ ] State
- [ ] Strategy
- [ ] Template method
- [ ] Visitor
